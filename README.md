# Catwalk

> Catwalk is an e-commerce site selling a variety of clothing products. This project creates the questions and answers module (search, display, contribute to, and report questions and answers for an individual product) for the Catwalk product detail page. This project was developed as one micorservice for the entire product detail page in a service oriented architecture. Other related services (image carousel, product information, product description, and reviews) are all unified with this service.
